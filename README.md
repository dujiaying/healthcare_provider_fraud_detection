# Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection

Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems facing Medicare. According to the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.

The goal of this project is to predict the potentially fraudulent providers based on the claims filed by them. Along with this, we will also study fraudulent patterns in providerâ€™s claims to understand the behavior of providers.
